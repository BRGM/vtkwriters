A set of pure python routines to write KitWare VTK files.
This is just conveniencies that I use an other may find usefull.
You migh also be interested in packages like `meshio <https://github.com/nschloe/meshio>`_

As of version 0.0.1 all routines are in a single (and much too big) file and CI is not really set up.
